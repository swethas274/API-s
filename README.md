3. Open the relevant files to explore API concepts.

## 🌐 Understanding APIs
### 1️⃣ What is an API?
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows one software application to communicate with another.

### 2️⃣ What is a REST API?
A **REST API (Representational State Transfer API)** follows RESTful principles to allow interaction with web services using standard HTTP methods:
- `GET` → Retrieve data
- `POST` → Create new data
- `PUT` → Update existing data
- `DELETE` → Remove data

### 3️⃣ Understanding JSON
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data format commonly used for API responses. Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "age": 25
}
```

## 🛠 Sample API Request
Using `curl`:
```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/users" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Using Python (requests library):
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")
print(response.json())
```
